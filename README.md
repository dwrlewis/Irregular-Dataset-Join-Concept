Data Concatenation and Conversion Tool

Much of the original content of this tool has been anonymised due to GDPR rules regarding the original test data it was designed for. What follows is a stripped-down version of the original, eliminating entire sections involving personal info, and using test data that has been manually generated and entirely randomised. No Reference Codes, Area’s, test values or comments present in the test data provided correlate to any of the original data this tool was intended for.

This program is intended as an aid for the concatenation and joining of multiple .xlsx datasets to quickly flag up instances of missing join ID’s, inconsistent values between files, and common formatting errors.
